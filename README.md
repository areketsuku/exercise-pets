# Exercise

This is a rework of a challenge from ISDI Coders fullstack bootcamp. I've choosed to start from the beginning instead of refactor the original work I made in order to achieve the same result from a diferent perspective.

## Objective

Using only HTML & CSS, create a page as close to the reference (mobile & desktop).
